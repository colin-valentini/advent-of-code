**Advent of Code** is an
[Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small
programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be
solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep,
company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or
to challenge each other.
